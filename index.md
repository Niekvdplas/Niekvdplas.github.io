**TL;DR:**  MAND Short summary of the paper. This should be a 4-5 sentences paragraph, containing the motivation of the paper, its goal, a bit of its research method, results, and implication.

------------------

## Motivation and goal

An important aspect of any work is the physical environment that it takes place in. In modern software development, teams are collaborating across borders, use agile software development and use a variety of tools to communicate and collaborate effectively. The changes in today's development practices call for renewed insights in the effect of the physical environment on the engineer's satisfaction and productivity. This will reduce attrition and avoid overworking engineers.

An empirical study of physical work environments was done at Microsoft. To determine the best physical environment for engineers, Johnson et al did a mixed methods study to assess the important factors in the physical environment that affect the engineer's satisfaction and productivity. An investigation was also done to determine how these factors differ between software engineers and office workers in non-development roles at Microsoft.

---------------------

## Methodology

In this research, three different data gathering actions were taken. Initially, a small survey was conducted to determine a baseline of important factors for productivity and satisfaction of software engineers. Of the 297 respondents that filled out this survey, 19 were interviewed personally to determine what factors were important to them. The relevant parts of the transcript were used to determine more specific important factors and thought processes behind the answers. The answers to both conducted research parts were used to design a follow-up survey that was consisted of more specific questions, to conclude clear factors that either helped or harmed productivity and work satisfaction for software engineers.

One linear regression model was generated to model satisfaction, while two linear regression models were generated to model perceived productivity. These models are based on correlations among survey responses with Likert-scale questions. Logistic regression was used to identify how certain demographics, such as gender and age distributions, responded to the questions.

## Results

With their mixed-methods survey the authors uncovered many findings among different teams within Microsoft. Their research pinned down key elements that lead to greater satisfaction and perceived productivity in a business setting. Through their surveys and interviews, they uncovered various themes
and factors regarding work environments.

* Personalization
    * 67.4% of surveyed personalize their work environment
    * Work environment was mostly personalized through family photo's (65.6% surveyed), awards (62.0%) & coffee mugs (59.7%).
    * People working in an open environment are less likely to personalize.
    * People working in a team are less likely to personalize as their team does it for them.
* Social norms and signals
    *  Social norms are present in 45% of participants environment and are more frequent in private offices (50.7%) than in work environments with > 15 people (35.4%).
    * There is no relationship between seniority of software engineers and perceived productivity and satisfaction.
* Room composition & atmosphere
    * Software engineers feel more productive in an open environment if there is a team member in the same space.
    * Many interviewee's have problems with the noise in the office.
* Work-related environment affordances
    * Software engineers like being able to work in private
    * Software engineers working on confidential work felt their environmental needs were not always met.
    * There is a positive relation between perceived productivity and the ease of booking a conference room.
* Work area & furniture
    * Furniture provided to a software engineer can affect the productivity.
* Productivity strategies
    * Software engineers prefer not to work from home and only to WFH when they feel unproductive at work.
    * Having windows in office sustains attention to work.

## Implications

The conclusions drawn from this paper are beneficial for several party's. Most obvious, it is useful for employers who want to increase the productivity to bump up the efficiency and thus to increase profits made. Using the results of this paper, employers can decide how to set up their workspaces so as to increase the productivity of their employees. Next to that, they can use the statistical models to find the most effective techniques to do so that fit their needs best.

This paper also has implications for the employee as he or she can also learn useful techniques to increase his or her productivity and satisfaction. The employee can apply the conclusions himself if management is lackluster in this area. The effects of applying some of the findings in this paper could improve the productivity on an individual level also which could lead to a higher salary or promotion on consistant results.

The last group of people that could benefit from this paper are students. While this paper mostly targets software engineers, it also mentions that many of these factors could also be beneficial to other demographics. Students could adopt several findings such as the presence of many windows, ergonomic furnuture or talking to other classmates to increase perceived productivity and satisfaction.

## Threats to the validity

An inherent limitation to this type of study is that causality is not proven, only implied. On top of that, the researchers have used their own wordings of factors or concepts, which make the research prone to misunderstandings in respondents. In addition to the surveys, the researchers did an interview with only 19 respondents out of the 297 respondents on the initial survey. This small sample size may have lead to the researchers coming to factors that may not be as important, or the researchers missing factors that might have been the most important. These factors should measure satisfaction and *perceived* productivity. This measure is not objective, which may lead to certain factors not being as important to objective productivity. What is also important to note, is that this entire study was done within the employees of the company Microsoft. Therefore, the conclusions may have been the result of certain internal factors such as social norms and company culture that are only present within Microsoft. Differences between groups such as teams and project types cannot be determined in the conclusions, as all groups are treated as if they were the same group. Further conclusions that may have not been objectively accurate can be the result of people answering questions in a way that might be viewed favorably by others, instead of answering them more honestly.

For future work, this research can be done again but this time with performance measures in place to actually measure productivity of software engineers rather than them self-reporting their perceived productivity. One should also look in to places of work other than physical, many companies nowadays have a suite of software tools and virtual workspaces for their employees which also significantly impact productivity and satisfaction. The relationship between these tools, virtual and physical workspaces could also be researched which may lead to surprising results. One could also do further research on the individual as certain people work better with a specific working style than others, it would be interesting to know the impact of working styles and personality types on the productivity and satisfaction of software engineers.

Iets over dat het perceived is vanuit de employee.

Iets over dat het alleen over een doelgroep gaat

Iets over dat het bij Microsoft zo is, hoeft niet overal zo te gaan?
