**TL;DR:** Short summary of the paper. This should be a 4-5 sentences paragraph, containing the motivation of the paper, its goal, a bit of its research method, results, and implication.

------------------

## Motivation and goal

An important aspect of any work is the physical environment that it takes place in. 

---------------------

## Methodology

In this research, three different data gathering actions were taken. Initially, a small survey was conducted to determine a baseline of important factors for productivity and satisfaction of software engineers. Of the 297 respondents that filled out this survey, 19 were interviewed personally to determine what factors were important to them. The relevant parts of the transcript were used to determine more specific important factors and thought processes behind the answers. The answers to both conducted research parts were used to design a follow-up survey that was consisted of more specific questions, to conclude clear factors that either helped or harmed productivity and work satisfaction for software engineers.

One linear regression model was generated to model satisfaction, while two linear regression models were generated to model perceived productivity. These models are based on correlations among survey responses with Likert-scale questions. Logistic regression was used to identify how certain demographics, such as gender and age distributions, responded to the questions.

## Results

With their mixed-methods survey the authors uncovered many findings among different teams within Microsoft. Their research pinned down key elements that lead to greater satisfaction and perceived productivity in a business setting. Through their surveys and interviews, they uncovered various themes
and factors regarding work environments.

* Personalization
    * 67.4% of surveyed personalize their work environment
    * Work environment was mostly personalized through family photo's (65.6% surveyed), awards (62.0%) & coffee mugs (59.7%).
    * People working in an open environment are less likely to personalize.
    * People working in a team are less likely to personalize as their team does it for them.
* Social norms and signals
    *  Social norms are present in 45% of participants environment and are more frequent in private offices (50.7%) than in work environments with > 15 people (35.4%).
    * There is no relationship between seniority of software engineers and perceived productivity and satisfaction.
* Room composition & atmosphere
    * Software engineers feel more productive in an open environment if there is a team member in the same space.
    * Many interviewee's have problems with the noise in the office.
* Work-related environment affordances
    * Software engineers like being able to work in private
    * Software engineers working on confidential work felt their environmental needs were not always met.
    * There is a positive relation between perceived productivity and the ease of booking a conference room.
* Work area & furniture
    * Furniture provided to a software engineer can affect the productivity.
* Productivity strategies
    * Software engineers prefer not to work from home and only to WFH when they feel unproductive at work.
    * Having windows in office sustains attention to work.

## Implications

The conclusions drawn from this paper are beneficial for several party's. Most obvious, it is useful for employers who want to increase the productivity to bump up the efficiency and thus to increase profits made. Using the results of this paper, employers can decide how to

* 2 paragraphs explaining the overall motivation and goal of the paper.
* 1-2 paragraphs explaining the methodology 
* 2-3 paragraphs explaining the results. Make use of figures and charts if needed.
* 2-3 paragraphs explaining the implications of this paper for practitioners
* 2 paragraphs discussing threats to the validity of the paper and future work.

Other notes:

* This is just a suggestion. Feel free to deviate from it if you see fit.
* Use markdown. Feel free to use italics and bold sentences to highlight important parts of the summary.
* If you want to reference another paper, you have to do it manually. Use, e.g., "as done by Doe et al [1]". Add [1] in the end of the summary.
