TL;DR: Short summary of the research idea. This should be a 4-5 sentences paragraph, containing the motivation of the paper, its goal, a bit of its research method, results, and implication.

## Introduction

One of the most important tasks managers or product owners have is to improve productivity of their employees. Some of these managers use several metrics to track, and give feedback to, their developers so they know whether they are performing well or in what areas they can improve. Most still lack such a feedback system and rely on the developer reflecting back on his own _perceived_ productivity. 

Many factors impact the productivity of a developer. Oliveira *et al* found that certain code characteristics correlated with the productivity of an employee as observed by the manager. These metrics could be measured automatically and given as feedback to both the employees and the managers. 

The effect this would have on the employees could go both ways. The employees could feel an incentive to work harder, as their productivity is being measured and they want the company to think that they are delivering good work. However, the additional surveillance could put more stress on the employees, causing them to be more unhappy, which could reduce their problem solving abilities (Graziotin, 2014).

Managers could use this information to keep an eye on certain employees that might have a reason to be less productive. They could then optimize the workflow of these employees to improve their productivity. They could also look at the most productive employees and see what they are doing right, to streamline the workflow of the team.

Our research question follows from these hypotheses and is as follows: *"Does objectively measuring productivity of software developers and giving this feedback to both the developers and managers have a positive impact on team productivity?"* 


To answer this, we will assess different businesses which all use the same programming language in a controlled experiment where one group gets weekly feedback on their productivity and have a survey at the end of our research period to answer our research questions.

## Research method

The goal of this study is to find out what the effect of different kind of measurements are on the productivity of both managers and developers. For us to research this, we want to rule out as many variables as possible. Thus, we will approach several companies varying from small(< 5 workers) to large (> 100) which are developing in the same programming language. To measure productivity we will use different Key Performance Indicators(KPIs) for managers and developers.

During our study, we have several research questions which we would want answered:
* What is the effect on managers/developers when they know that developer productivity is objectively being measured?
* Does knowing you are being objectively measured give developers an incentive to be more productive?
* Does productivity measurements give managers the tools to optimize their team?
* Is there a difference between the developer's perceived productivity and their actual productivity? 

To find out what the effect is on both managers and developers when they know that productivity is objectively being measured we will exectute the experiment in a controlled environment where half of the pool knows they are being measured and receive weekly updates through graphs and tables of their productivity and half do not. This way we can look at what happens to the performance indicators throughout the weeks. With this controlled experiment we can immediately answer our second research question since we can determine whether or not the thought of being actively measured through these KPIs incentivizes developers to be more productive.

For the third research question, we will analyse the KPIs of the managers and determine whether there is a statistical difference between the two groups in the experiment. Next to that, we will send out a survey which they all have to fill out which can then be analyzed by us to determine whether the perceived productivity of the managers also was different from actual productivity.

Our fourth research question will also be answered through a more extensive survey at the end of the study. All developers will have to fill this out and with this data we will be able to determine if there exists a statistical difference between perceived and objectively measured productivity.

Why We Should Not Measure Productivity
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4842-4221-6_3

- Measuring productivity creates a different incentive. For example, creative processes might not occur as regularly when, for example, lines of code is measured.
- A team might ship more defects or introduce technical debt.
- Trying to optimize for a single measure such as bugs closed, user stories finished or number of customers acquired always comes at the expense of other metrics.
- Avoid Big Brother situation.
- This book does not seem to have done any empirical studies, only thought experiments.
- Managers cannot understand the full picture and can therefore not make logical objective decisions.
- Doing experiments to measure productivity is not doable, since there are too many individual differences.
- The ultimate bottleneck in this experiment is behavior change.

- Improving productivity requires explaining the factors that affect it, but that requires qualitative insights into team behavior.
- Teams are always changing, making it even harder to get insights about team behavior through data.

Code and commit metrics of developer productivity: a study on team leaders perceptions
https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-020-09820-z.pdf

- Asked leaders about the productivity of their team and looked for correlations between this opinion and metrics.
- Our quantitative data suggest a greater correlation of the leaders’ perceptions with codebased metrics when compared to commit-based metrics. Our qualitative data reveal that leaders have positive impressions of code-based metrics and potentially would adopt them.
- Developer productivity is essential to the success of development projects.
- Team leaders’ perceptions are usually the primary source of information when project managers make decisions about development teams.
- Perceptions are subjective and biased. Thus, a systematic productivity assessment could help team leaders in their work.

- Managers are best positioned to get these qualitative insights by interacting with their team.
- Many studies neglecting the analysis on the developer level.
- Uses characteristics in (1) source code and (2) commits.

Metrics (source code):
- Source Lines of Code by Time (SLOC/Time)
- Halstead Effort by Time (HalsteadEff/Time): source code complexity
- Code Owned by Time (CodeOwned/Time): if the highest percentage of lines is a developer's, then the developer is the owner for this metric.

Metrics (commits):
- Commits Performed by Time (Commits/Time)
- Committed Source Lines of Code by Time (CommittedSLOC/Time) 
- Committed Characters by Time (CommittedChars/ Time)

Results:
- Assessing developer productivity via commit-based metrics is tricky. The eight interviewed leaders are unanimous in stating that commit-based metrics strongly dependent on developers’ commit habits; thus, these metrics are quite unreliable. Particularly, team leaders expressed their concern about being unfair with developers who commit less but produce more complex program features than other developers. Therefore, we have learned that using commit-based metrics to assess developer productivity is tricky in practice.
- Code ownership as a key to assessing developer productivity. Our results were encouraging for code-based metrics: all code-based metrics are strongly correlated with team leaders’ perceptions of developer productivity.
- To what extent code-based and commit-based can complement the team leaders’ perceptions of their developer’ productivity? In summary, our results suggest that productivity metrics, especially code-based metrics, can complement the subjective perception of team leaders. Important results: revealing aspects of developer productivity not previously known, boost the fairness of productivity assessment, and acknowledge those developers that are productive
but underestimated.

The Work Life of Developers: Activities, Switches and Perceived Productivity
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7829407

-  All too often, efforts aimed at improving developer productivity are undertaken without knowledge about how developers spend their time at work and how it influences their own perception of productivity. 
- Researchers have investigated work practices and work fragmentation in detail from various perspectives, specifically the effect of interruptions on fragmentation and how developers organize their work in terms of tasks and working spheres.
- We did find that many developers consider email, planned meetings and work unrelated browsing as less productive activities, and usually perceive themselves as more productive when they have a higher user input rate as measured by mouse clicks and keystrokes.
- Developers’ work is highly fragmented, as developers are spending only very short amounts of time (0.3 to 2 minutes) in one activity before switching to another one.
- Table of multiple findings, such as 'Developers only spend about half their time active on their computer.'.

Towards an evidence-based theoretical framework on factors influencing the software development productivity
https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-020-09844-5.pdf

- To evolve and replicate a systematic literature review (SLR) on software development productivity measurement and prediction methods.
- Productivity has been studied at least for three decades.
- Despite the number of available empirical studies on software productivity, the researchers have faced issues in employing the produced knowledge and synthesizing a theoretical framework from them.

Table 6 summarizes the important findings:
- In general, as more significant the increments of product’s LOC-based size over time, as higher the positive impact on software development productivity.
- Newer programming languages positively contribute more to software development productivity than older ones.
- Communication among developers positively affects and is necessary for software development productivity.
- Combining the use of methods and techniques regarding verification, validation, testing, or any other related to quality assurance has positive effects on software productivity.
- The long-term effect of increasing the project duration promotes slight losses in software development productivity.

- Most employees need motivation to feel good about their jobs and perform optimally, intrinsic or extrinisic
- Motivation through incentives(Bonusses)
- The link between performance and employee motivation is very complex. 
- Motivation is very important for every company to improve the employee performance and productivity of the organization.

How have Software Engineering Researchers been Measuring Software Productivity? 
https://www.scitepress.org/papers/2017/63144/63144.pdf

- researchers have not yet reached a consensus on how to properly measure productivity in software engineering.
- Measurement of productivity is necessary to assess the efficiency of software organizations and improving it can lower cost(Demarco, 1986) and time-to-market (Boehm, 1987) + increases competitivity within market. (Aquino Junior and Meira, 2009)

Happiness and the productivity of software engineers
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4842-4221-6_10

- Software companies nowadays often aim for flourishing happiness among developers such as perks.
- happy developers are **supposedly** more productive and, hopefully, also retained.
- To access skills and knowledge (which are in term needed to increase productivity), there need to be favorable conditions that allow the human potential to be realized, satisfaction, and thus happiness, is important because it can realize this potential.
- Happy developers solve problems better (Graziotin, 2014).
- Happiness and unhappiness influence how we can focus while coding, as put by one participant: “[…] The negative feelings lead to not thinking things through as clearly as I would have if the feeling of frustration was not present.”
- Unhappiness leads to low motivation for developing software
- Issue with research on happiness is that it is challenging to control the happiness of people. 
- Software productivity is still often managaed as if it were about delivering code on an assembly line.
- Link between happiness and productivity is real and many companies are starting to invest in employees well-being.
- Happiness and unhappiness bring a plethora of benefits and detriments to software development processes, people, and products.
