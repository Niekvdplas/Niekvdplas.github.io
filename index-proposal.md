TL;DR: Short summary of the research idea. This should be a 4-5 sentences paragraph, containing the motivation of the paper, its goal, a bit of its research method, results, and implication.

## Introduction

The introduction should be 4-5 paragraphs, explaining the overall motivation and goal of the paper. 

* Explain the broader topic of research
* Explain the research gap: what are we missing?
* YOUR RESEARCH, YOUR GENIUS IDEA
* Put your main research question
* A summary of the research method




## Background and Related Work 

"Show off" your knowledge of the area; it gives all the background that the reader needs to understand your work; it gives an overview of the entire research area around the topic

* Write a background and/or related work selections
	* Background: Background knowledge that the reader needs
	* Related work: Papers that are related to your research and that the reader can use to compare with your work

* One paragraph per paper. Some sentences explaining what the paper is about. Some sentences explaining the methodology and results of the paper. Maybe limitations or future work. Maybe some comparison with the work you are doing.

* At least 10 papers in the related work section. Do not go over 15 papers.

## Research method

What you are going to research and how.

* State your research goal. "The goal of this study is to explore the relationship between sunlight and defects in open-source systems".
* What method are you doing to use? 
* Write down clear research questions (RQ1, RQ2, ...)
* For each RQ, describe the method you are going to use to answer the RQ
* Explain any datasets you are going to reuse or create. Why is this dataset the right one for your project?
* Explain any (human) subjects you are going to reuse or create. How are you going to find them? Why are they the right people to take part of your study?
* Explain any data analysis techniques you plan to use. Are you going to use some stastistical test? Which one? Why?

## Execution plan

How to run this study?

* How you would you then run this study?

Why We Should Not Measure Productivity
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4842-4221-6_3

- Measuring productivity creates a different incentive. For example, creative processes might not occur as regularly when, for example, lines of code is measured.
- A team might ship more defects or introduce technical debt.
- Trying to optimize for a single measure such as bugs closed, user stories finished or number of customers acquired always comes at the expense of other metrics.
- Avoid Big Brother situation.
- This book does not seem to have done any empirical studies, only thought experiments.
- Managers cannot understand the full picture and can therefore not make logical objective decisions.
- Doing experiments to measure productivity is not doable, since there are too many individual differences.
- The ultimate bottleneck in this experiment is behavior change.

- Improving productivity requires explaining the factors that affect it, but that requires qualitative insights into team behavior.
- Teams are always changing, making it even harder to get insights about team behavior through data.
- Managers are best positioned to get these qualitative insights by interacting with their team.
- Many studies neglecting the analysis on the developer level.

Code and commit metrics of developer productivity: a study on team leaders perceptions
https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10664-020-09820-z.pdf

- Asked leaders about the productivity of their team and looked for correlations between this opinion and metrics.
- Our quantitative data suggest a greater correlation of the leaders’ perceptions with codebased metrics when compared to commit-based metrics. Our qualitative data reveal that leaders have positive impressions of code-based metrics and potentially would adopt them.
- Developer productivity is essential to the success of development projects.
- Team leaders’ perceptions are usually the primary source of information when project managers make decisions about development teams.
- Perceptions are subjective and biased. Thus, a systematic productivity assessment could help team leaders in their work.

- Most employees need motivation to feel good about their jobs and perform optimally, intrinsic or extrinisic
- Motivation through incentives(Bonusses)
- The link between performance and employee motivation is very complex. 
- Motivation is very important for every company to improve the employee performance and productivity of the organization.

How have Software Engineering Researchers been Measuring Software Productivity? 
https://www.scitepress.org/papers/2017/63144/63144.pdf

- researchers have not yet reached a consensus on how to properly measure productivity in software engineering.
- Measurement of productivity is necessary to assess the efficiency of software organizations and improving it can lower cost(Demarco, 1986) and time-to-market (Boehm, 1987) + increases competitivity within market. (Aquino Junior and Meira, 2009)
